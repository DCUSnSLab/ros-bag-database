# Installation

The Bag Database can be set up in multiple different ways depending on what functionality you
need; the pages in this category have a variety of examples that you can customize.

If you just want to get something up and running quickly to test it out, I recommend looking at
[Without Authentication](docker/without-authentication) first.
